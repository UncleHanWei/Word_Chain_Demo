# Word Chain Demo
## About
某天突發奇想，想把文字接龍的遊戲寫出來
此專案只是試作，先將規劃中最簡單的部分寫出來
之後再蒐集玩家回饋以作為後續正式版的改進目標

## Game Rule
Demo 版僅有單人棋盤模式(也許可以有別的稱呼?)
- 單人棋盤模式
    - 玩家先選擇難度(簡單、普通、困難)，困難度會影響棋盤大小
    - 遊戲一開始畫面會隨機出現一個字，玩家必須用該字造詞並進行接龍
    - 每次造詞只能使用兩個字的詞(即輸入含題目的字之外，再加一字的詞，例如:題目為"天"，玩家則輸入 "天才")
    - 遊戲持續至玩家填滿棋盤(玩家勝利)或按下放棄鍵(玩家失敗)

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
